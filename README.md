## PPO

An implementation of PPO with recent random improvements

The phasic part has been removed, repository to be renamed. I do not think it does anything

## Install

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to install `swig`

```bash
$ apt install swig
```

## Use

```bash
$ python train.py
```
